# Three.js Hackathon – DataPlay 3D  

I participated in the **DataPlay 3D Hackathon**, an event focused on using **Three.js** to create playful, visually engaging 3D experiences powered by real-world data.  

### Project Overview  
My idea was to develop a **futuristic city** inhabited by **aliens, robots, humans, and apes**, featuring dynamic interactions and real-time data updates. The project incorporated:  

- **Alien Collision Detection:** Simulated spaceship crashes in the sky, triggering a live counter update.  
- **Weather-Responsive Night Sky:** Intended to integrate a weather API to adjust the night sky based on real-time weather conditions.  
- **AI-Driven Interactions:** Planned to use the OpenAI API for dynamic user interactions based on predefined prompts.  
- **Procedurally Generated News Headlines:** Implemented a locally stored list of randomly generated, humorous news headlines displayed on a city billboard at each refresh. This feature was intended to leverage OpenAI for added creativity.  

Due to time constraints, I was only able to implement the core features visible in the current version. However, this is a project I would love to revisit in the future.  

### 🏆 Award & Recognition  
**"Technically Ambitious" – Alien Collisions**  
Awarded for pushing the boundaries of simulation mechanics within the hackathon timeframe.  

### 🗓️ Event Highlights  
- **Kick-Off & Workshops:** Hands-on learning sessions to get up to speed with Three.js.  
- **Coffee & Critique:** Midweek feedback sessions that helped refine project ideas.  
- **Demo Showcase:** Presented in a live demo format—no slides, just code and creativity!  

### 🏆 Judging Criteria  
- **Creativity & Originality**  
- **Technical Execution**  
- **User Interaction & Engagement**  
- **Innovative Use of Data**  

This hackathon was a great opportunity to explore **Three.js, AI integrations, and data-driven 3D environments** while pushing the boundaries of interactive web experiences.
